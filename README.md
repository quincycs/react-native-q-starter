# react-native-q-starter

An opinionated launch point for an react-native app already built with some very common features for most apps.

**Started with expo's tabs new project template.**

- 37SDK (react-native 0.61 & react 16.9) / jest / react-navigation / testing utils

**Added typescript**

- ts-jest / @types
- eslint
  - rules based from react-native repo itself. [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/.eslintrc)
- minimal babel 7
  - no "rn-cli-config.js" or weird babel transforms

**Additional Features**

- prettier (code formatting)
- husky (code format & test each commit and push)
- allTypes.d.ts (Common types & missing types)
- sentry-expo (production error tracking)
  - [app.json (extra)](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/configuration/#extra)
  - app.json (extra.sentryDNS) - https://sentry.io/settings/your-org/projects/your-project/keys/
  - app.json (extra.sentryEnable) - [Sentry.enableInExpoDevelopment](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-sentry/)
  - [app.json (hooks)](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-sentry/) - for sourcemaps
- Logged out / Signed in screens with Auth nav flow and sign out functionality.
- Secure device storage. (e.g. of auth token & logged in state)
- Localization / Pattern for supporting multiple languages.
- Firebase REST API integration. (Authentication)
- Reusable Web API pattern. Cancellation support. Error handling / User friendly messages pattern.
- Screen Deeplinking (see HomeScreen's componentDidMount)

## Setup from fresh OS

- Install Node10 and Yarn
  - Mac
    - Install node via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
    - `nvm install 10.17.0` (where the version is latest 10.x) [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)
    - `brew install yarn --without-node` [more info](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yarn)
  - Windows
    - Node [install](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/). I'd try the "-x64.msi" one.
    - Yarn [install](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).
  - Verify node version: `node -v` says version 10.
- Download this github repo as a .zip
- Rename various placeholder names for your project.
  - Package.json - "name"
  - app.json - "name" / "slug".
  - Oh and the 'react-native-q-starter' folder ;)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

## Recommended IDE & Extensions

- VS code [install](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- VS code integration should just work after installing these extensions:
  - ESLint [install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - Prettier [install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - React Native Tools [install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsmobile.vscode-react-native)
  - Visual Studio IntelliCode [install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)

## Process for keeping up to date

Update schedule: ~1 month after new expo SDK release. This gives the SDK some time to soak.

**Below is my plan on updating package.json**

NEW-TABS:
Create a temporary new project via: `expo init`.
Generate the tabs project.
Look at the package.json / node_modules for dependency versions.

TYPES:
Align @types/XYZ with the closest version of XYZ. (Sometimes you wonâ€™t get full alignment. In that case choose a version lower.)

NEW-SDK-BLOG:
The [Expo Blog](https://blog.expo.io/) always publishes a post when SDK is released about breaking changes / how to update dependencies.

ALIGN-JEST-TS:
Align version with supported jest version and typescript version. Look at the latest version that supports our jest & typescript versions. Open package.json and search for "jest" , "typescript". [link](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/blob/master/package.json)

RN:
Look at [react-native's package.json](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/package.json) and consider using the same eslint plugins. (e.g. adding any plugin that they have.)

   "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": RN
   "eslint-plugin-react-native": RN
 },
```

**Plan for keeping eslintrc up to date:**

Consider keeping "plugins", "rules", "globals" in sync with [react-native's eslintrc](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/.eslintrc). Keep personal / project preferences intact at the top of "rules". Don't use any flow plugins or flow related rules. VScode should complain about any duplicate rules.

**Plan for keeping tsconfig up to date:**

Inside allTypes.d.ts, re-evaluate any `declare module "XXX";`. Overtime these modules might exist in the dependency already or via DefinitelyTyped via npm `@types/XXX`.

Inside tsconfig.json, "types" should be any "@types/" we have inside our package.json. This is how we resolve conflicting types. Try removing "types" which will cause tsc include all types, and you'll see the errors that are being avoided.

**SDK Update Notes**

I tried updating the following around SDK 36, but tests failed after any of them were updated. More time is needed to figure out these upgrades.

- sentry-expo (2.0.1)

I also tried updating react-navigation (a major version increase). However, more time is needed to figure out the migration & fixing the type issues that came up. Specifically how to fix the type error for AppNavigator.ts for `Deep: { screen: DeepScreen },`.
